                                I have known Aunty'B'Compere for over two decades when we were young girls, she is coordinated and always on point.
                                In 2013 we needed someone to organize a regional program to celebrate children at my office (Diamond Bank) on children's day and this was given to Aunty'B'Compere to plan. She did a great job in planning the event, recommended a great venue and all logistics were handled by her. All the children had fun and had a great time at the event. I will recommend Aunty'B'Compere for any event planning, logistics, MC , games etc. Oluwaseun Area Sales Mgr
